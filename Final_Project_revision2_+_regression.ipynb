For the top 5 counties 46% of total votes went to the Republican party and 22% went to the Democratic party whereas for the bottom 5 counties 37% went to the Democratic party and 29% went to the Republican party. This falls inline with our assumption that that individuals with larger properties, like farmers, tend to lean toward the Republican party. In addition to that, we also notice that the top 5 counties have a significantly lower ammount of total votes than the bottom 5 counties. This makes intuitive sense as smaller property sizes may point toward more densly populated regions and as a result more votes. The data above may suggest that people with larger property may be more inclined to vote Red (Republican)."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "f67ba2ed-744c-47fa-a57e-078f918192e0", "metadata": {}, "source": " ## Comparing Counties - Home size"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "88c32fcf-c508-429e-9188-c3b5b87385a3", "metadata": {}, "source": "    The relation of property size to voter patterns has raised an interesting question, does home size have a relation to voting patterns as well?.
